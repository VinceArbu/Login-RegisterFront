Our social media project employs GitHub for version control, collaboration, and Visual Studio Code as our source code editor. We have categorized our codebase to separate JavaScript, HTML, and CSS style functions based on their respective roles in the front-end design.

JavaScript is the foundation of our project, serving as the backbone for the website's front-end functionality and as the language for structuring our custom API. This integration facilitates seamless communication between the user interface and the server, resulting in a dynamic and responsive user experience.

Moreover, we utilize the fetch API method to gather data from various sources, allowing us to dynamically populate news sections on the website. This approach ensures a constantly updated and engaging user experience, while also establishing scalable and efficient data management within our social media project.
