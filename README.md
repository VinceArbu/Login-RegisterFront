Our social media project employs GitHub for version control, collaboration, and Visual Studio Code as our source code editor. We have categorized our codebase to separate JavaScript, HTML, and CSS style functions based on their respective roles in the front-end design.

JavaScript is the foundation of our project, serving as the backbone for the website's front-end functionality and as the language for structuring our custom API. This integration facilitates seamless communication between the user interface and the server, resulting in a dynamic and responsive user experience.

Moreover, we utilize the fetch API method to gather data from various sources, allowing us to dynamically populate news sections on the website. This approach ensures a constantly updated and engaging user experience, while also establishing scalable and efficient data management within our social media project.

<br><h3>**What was your inspiration for the design of the website?** </h3> 

Our website design is a fusion of distinctive elements, drawing inspiration from three iconic brands - Discord, Twitter and Apple. We prioritize a clean and intuitive interface, inspired by Discord, to ensure an uncomplicated and user-friendly experience.

The neutral color background, similar to the classic Twitter layout, provides a calming backdrop, fostering readability and it is visually appealing. Additionally, we adopt Apple's approach to simplicity and concise features, focusing on essential functionalities without unnecessary complexities.

This blend of design inspirations reflects our commitment to creating a visually appealing, user-centric, and functionally efficient website for our users.

<br><h3>**What was your approach in creating the content of the website?** </h3> 

When building our website, we follow a systematic and collaborative approach. We start by brainstorming different layout designs on Figma to visualize and refine our ideas. We then test and fine-tune the functionalities to ensure that the user experience is seamless and user-friendly. 

Decisions about the color palette, website design, logo, and brand name are made through a majority vote to encourage inclusivity and diverse perspectives. Once the creative elements are agreed upon, we move on to the coding phase and methodically separate functions in JavaScript. We use Visual Studio Code to bring our code structure to life, combining precision and efficiency with creativity. 

This comprehensive process is a reflection of our commitment to creating a visually appealing, user-centric, and working website.
